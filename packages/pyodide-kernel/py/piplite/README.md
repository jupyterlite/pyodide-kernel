# piplite

This is a companion package to [micropip](https://github.com/pyodide/micropip) which
only works inside a [Pyodide](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/) runtime.

It adds the ability to use extra Warehouse-like API responses to resolve `pip`
dependencies, and can disable the fallback to `pypi.org`
