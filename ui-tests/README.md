# Integration Testing

This folder contains the integration tests of the extension.

They are defined using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) test runner and
[Galata](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/tree/main/galata) helper.

The Playwright configuration is defined in
[playwright.config.js](./playwright.config.js).

The default configuration will produce video for failing tests and an HTML report.
